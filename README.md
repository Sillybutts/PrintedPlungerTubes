# PrintedPlungerTubes
A set of fully printable plunger tubes!

## Description

These plunger tubes are a fully printed design that fits in standard TCs, Caliburns, Lynxes, etc, **without modification to the blaster**!

So far, there are plunger tubes in these sizes:
- 1.5" OD plunger tubes:
- - 4" (Esper, SillyPistol, etc)
- - 5.18" (Skewer, SkewBow, etc)
- - 5.72" (Talon Claw, Thumper, etc)
- - 7.3125" (Caliburn, MagBow, etc)
- - 8" (Lynx)

If you know of a blaster that uses a 1.5"OD plunger tube, and it isn't already on this list, let me know! I'll make a PT for it! Contact info in the Misc section of this listing.

## Assembly

Assembly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpMW5P51Vow

Make sure the smoothest side of the PT lining is facing the INSIDE of the PT. 

Printing on a smooth surface, like bare glass or PEI, gives you a smoother inside surface and better performance. 

When using these plunger tubes, use more lubrication than you normally would.

## Printing

All STLs were exported in print orientation. The F3D and STEP source files are also provided.

Print at 100% infill, 5 walls.
